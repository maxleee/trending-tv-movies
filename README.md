## Trending TV and Movies 🌈📺🎥✨
A personal project that fetches data from the [TV Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en-US) and displays a list of Trending TV Shows and Movies, with detail description pages of each Show and Movie.

### 🍎I used this project to learn:
React

React Hooks

Fetching Data from an API

styled-components for CSS-in-JS

react-spring for animation

I mostly followed Scott Tolinski's [Level Up Tutorials:](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/) 
React 16 for Everyone, Animating React, Level 2 React, and React Hooks for Everyone courses, along with documentation and other resources around the web.

### Some things I'd like to add to the app:
🔍Search functionality (the entire DB, not just trending)

📺Related Shows/Movies
